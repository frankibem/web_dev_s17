# Web Development - Short Course
This repository contains the accompanying code files for the Spring 2017 "Web development Short Course" at TTU.

The following topics will be introduced during 1.5hr meetings per week over the next 6 weeks:
* HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap framework
* JavaScript and the AngularJS framework
* Implementing and consuming Web APIs using Postman, AngularJS and ASP.NET Web API
* Real-time web using PubNub
* Web automation using Selenium Webdriver and NodeJS

The goal is to introduce students to a wide variety of topics using semi-practical examples to spur their interest and expose them to application development in an effort to prepare them for future software engineering classes.
